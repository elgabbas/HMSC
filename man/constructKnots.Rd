\usage{
constructKnots(sData, nKnots = NULL, knotDist = NULL, minKnotDist = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sData}{a dataframe containing spatial or temporal coordinates of units of the random level}

\item{nKnots}{the number of knots wanted on the spatial dimension with the shortest range}

\item{knotDist}{the distance between the wanted knots}

\item{minKnotDist}{the minimum distance of a knot to the nearest data point}
}
\value{
a data frame with knot locations
}
\description{
Construct a Regular Grid of Knot Locations for Spatial GPP Model
}
\details{
This is a helper function for spatial Hmsc models with the
    spatial method set to GPP where user must provide knot
    locations. Knot locations with a distance greater than
    \code{minKnotDist} to the nearest data point are dropped from
    the grid. If the input locations are
    spatial data of \CRANpkg{sf} package, these are treated like
    Euclidean coordinates, and if the points are not projected, a
    warning is issued.

Only one of \code{nKnots} and \code{minKnotDist} arguments can be provided.

\examples{
#Creating knots for some 2 dimensional spatial data
n = 100
xycoords = matrix(runif(2*n),ncol=2)
xyKnots = constructKnots(xycoords,knotDist = 0.2, minKnotDist = 0.5)
