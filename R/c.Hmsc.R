#' Combine Posterior Samples of Several Hmsc Models
#'
#' Function combines posterior samples of several sampled
#' \code{\link{Hmsc}} models (see \code{\link{sampleMcmc}}) as new
#' chains in the first fitted model. The combined models must be
#' comparable, and there are some tests for detecting non-equal
#' models. These tests will only give warning, and it is at user
#' deliberation to decide which models and which posterior samples can
#' be combined.  You should be careful not start two models from the
#' same random number seed, because these will only duplicate your
#' data instead of providing new independent samples.
#'
#' @param ... Sampled \code{Hmsc} models with posterior samples that
#'     will be added as new chaings in the first listed model.
#' @return An \code{\link{Hmsc}} model with chains of posterior
#'     samples.

#' ## Need more data? Add chains: check carefully that these are
#' ## sampled exactly like the previous model
#' m2 <- sampleMcmc(TD$m, nChains=2, samples=10, transient=5, verbose=0)
