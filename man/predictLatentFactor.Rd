\arguments{
\item{unitsPred}{a factor vector with random level units for which
predictions are to be made}

\item{units}{a factor vector with random level units that are
conditioned on}

\item{postEta}{a list containing samples of random factors at
conditioned units}

parameters for latent factors}

random level structure}

mean of the predictive Gaussian process distribution}

the samples from the mean-field distribution of the predictive
Gaussian process distribution}
}
\value{
a list of length \code{length(postEta)} containing samples
    of random factors at \code{unitsPred} from their predictive
    distribution conditional on the values at \code{units}
}
\description{
Draws samples from the conditional predictive
    distribution of latent factors
}
\details{
Length of \code{units} vector and number of rows in
    \code{postEta} matrix shall be equal. The method assumes that
    the i-th row of \code{postEta} correspond to i-th element of
    \code{units}.

  This method uses only the coordinates \code{rL$s} field of the
  \code{rL$s} argument. This field shall be a matrix with rownames
  covering the union of \code{unitsPred} and \code{units}
  factors. Alternatively, it can use distance matrix
  \code{rL$distMat} which is a symmetric square matrix with similar
  row names as the coordinate data (except for the GPP models that
  only can use coordinates).

  In case of spatial random level, the computational complexity of
  the generic method scales cubically as the number of unobserved
  units to be predicted. Both \code{predictMean=TRUE} and
  \code{predictMeanField=TRUE} options decrease the asymptotic
  complexity to linear. The \code{predictMeanField=TRUE} option
  also preserves the uncertainty in marginal distribution of
  predicted latent factors, but neglects the inter-dependence
  between them.
